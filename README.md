<h3>Python Practice Day</h3>
<ul>
<p><h3>Problem 1</h3><br>

Suppose you have a floating number N.1 then,
Floor is the greatest integer less than or equal to N. And Ceil is the smallest
number greater than or equal to N.
Example: for 3.4 Floor is 3 and Ceil if 4.

Write a python program that takes a floating number from users using input() and
outputs both Floor and Ceil of that number.</p>
<p><h3>Problem 2</h3><br>
Write a function that takes 3 integer inputs from user and
outputs absolute values of these integers without using any
library functions. 
 Sample Input:<br>
 -100<br>
  234<br>
 -350<br>
<br><br>
 Sample Output:<br>
 100<br>
 234<br>
 350<br>
</p>
<p><h3>Problem 3</h3>

In the famous Rock Paper Scissor game - Rock wins against scissors, paper wins
against rock, and scissors wins against paper.
Write a python program that takes two user inputs and returns who wins the game.
Sample Input:<br>
> Player 1: rock<br>
> Player 2: paper<br>
Sample Output:<br>
> Player 2 is the winner<br>
</p>
<p><h3>Problem 4</h3>

Write a Python program to check if user entered number is ZERO, POSITIVE or
NEGATIVE until user does not want to quit.
User will type ‘Quit’ to close the program.
Sample:<br>
> Enter input: 2<br>
> 2 is positive<br>
> -3<br>
> -3 is negative<br>
> “Quit”<br>
> (stop the program)<br>
</p>
<p><h3>Problem 5</h3>

Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three
print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers
which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
Sample Output :<br>
fizzbuzz<br>
1<br>
2<br>
fizz<br>
4<br>
buzz<br>
</p>
